# Objectives
In this section, I demonstrate my expertise in SQL by answering diverse business questions using Microsoft's Contoso Retail database. The topics covered include:

    - SQL Fundamentals (data types, operators, and syntax)
    - CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Conditional Functions (CASE, COALESCE, NULL handling)
    - Views (creating and optimizing for performance)
    - Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (enhancing query readability and efficiency)

These exercises showcase how SQL can be used to extract insights, streamline data operations, and support business decision-making.
