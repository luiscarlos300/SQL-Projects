# Introduction
This section showcases my expertise in SQL through practical case studies, covering key concepts and techniques, including:

    - Writing efficient queries for data retrieval and manipulation
    - Designing and optimizing relational databases
    - Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
    - Building reports and dashboards
    - Advanced data analysis and aggregation
    - Data manipulation, including:
        - Data extraction
        - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        - Data cleansing and transformation for analysis
    - Performance tuning and query optimization
    - SQL for technical interviews and problem-solving

These cases demonstrate how SQL can be leveraged to analyze data, optimize database performance, and support decision-making processes.
